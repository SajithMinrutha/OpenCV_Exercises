# OpenCV — My Exercises

This repository contains personal OpenCV exercises and experiments.

## Overview

A collection of small scripts and notebooks to practice computer vision techniques using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if `requirements.txt` is present):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install the basics:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Running exercises

Run any Python script from the repository root, for example:

```bash
python path/to/exercise_script.py
```

Jupyter notebooks can be opened with:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## Repository structure

- `exercises/` — your OpenCV scripts and notebooks
- `data/` — sample images and assets (if present)
- `.gitignore` — ignored files

## Contributing

Add new exercises as separate scripts or notebooks. Name files with a clear prefix (e.g., `01_basic_filters.py`).

## Notes

This README is a minimal starting point. Tell me if you want examples added, a `requirements.txt`, or instructions tailored to specific scripts.
